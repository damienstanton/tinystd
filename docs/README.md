This crate is a place where I take notes when learning about a particular data structure or algorithm in Rust, usually
by trying to implement a nominal version of the thing myself. 

Note that even though the crate is called `tinystd`, this
does _not_ mean that the crate will not arbitrarily have third-party dependencies in some cases.

Data structures implemented

- [x] `HashMap<K, V>`
- [x] `RefCell<T>`
- [x] `Rc<T>`
- [x] `channel::<T>`

Algorithms implemented:

- [x] `Bubblesort`
- [x] `Insertion sort (naive)`
- [x] `Insertion sort (using binary search)`
- [x] `Quicksort`

TODO:

- [ ] Unit tests for `RefCell`
- [ ] Unit tests for `Rc`
- [ ] Convert unit tests for sorting into better documentation (more literate style)
- Non-threadsafe things? E.g. `Arc` or `RwLock`?
