# ü§è tinystd

This crate is a place where I take notes when learning about a particular data structure or algorithm in Rust, usually
by trying to implement a nominal version of the thing myself.

Types implemented, in no particular order:

- [x] `HashMap<K, V>`
- [x] `RefCell<T>`
- [x] `Rc<T>`

TODO:

- [ ] Unit tests for `RefCell`
- [ ] Unit tests for `Rc`
- Non-threadsafe things? E.g. `Arc` or `RwLock`?
